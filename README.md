# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML

That is my first ML project! <br />
It is supposed to predict the salary that people are making so the ml charity could ask those people for donations using some given features.<br />
I used some python libires for that project: Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn.<br />
The stages of that project were: 
1-Exploring the given data.<br />
2-Transforming Skewed Continuous Features.<br />
3-Data Preprocessing : I implemented one-hot encoding  on some features.<br />
4-shuffling and spliting data.<br />
5-Chosing the metrics and a Naive Predictor.<br />
6-I choosed three of the supervised learning models available on Sklearn - Decision Tree, SVC and Gradient Boosting - and tested them and Gradient Boosting was the best one.<br />
7-Finally I Extract the feature importances using .feature_importances_ after training the model using the whole data not only the training set.<br />
